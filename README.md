I discovered this course through a YouTuber named Midudev, and I was immediately captivated by it. This course is an introduction to modern web development with JavaScript, focusing primarily on building single-page applications using React, supported by RESTful and GraphQL web services with Node.js. It also covers essential topics like TypeScript, React Native, and Continuous Integration.

Additionally, it dives into debugging, container technology, configuration, managing runtime environments, and databases. The best part? The course is entirely free, and you can even earn a certificate and University of Helsinki ECTS credits at no cost.

Thank you so much to everyone involved in making this opportunity to learn and grow possible.
